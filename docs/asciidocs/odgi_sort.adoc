== NAME

odgi_sort - sort a variation graph

== SYNOPSIS

*odgi sort* [*-i, --idx*=_FILE_] [*-o, --out*=_FILE_] [_OPTION_]...

== DESCRIPTION

The odgi sort(1) command sorts a succinct variation graph. Odgi sort offers a diverse palette of sorting algorithms to
determine the node order:

 - A topological sort: A graph can be sorted via https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search[breadth-first search (BFS)] or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search[depth-first search (DFS)]. Optionally,
   a chunk size specifies how much of the graph to grab at once in each topological sorting phase. The sorting algorithm will continue the sort from the
   next node in the prior graph order that has not been sorted, yet. The cycle breaking algorithm applies a DFS sort until
   a cycle is found. We break and start a new DFS sort phase from where we stopped.
 - A random sort: The graph is randomly sorted. The node order is randomly shuffled from http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/random/mt19937/[Mersenne Twister pseudo-random] generated numbers.
 - A 1D linear SGD sort: Odgi implements a 1D linear, variation graph adjusted, multi-threaded version of the https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04626[Graph Drawing
   by Stochastic Gradient Descent] algorithm. The force-directed graph drawing algorithm minimizes the graph's energy function
   or stress level. It applies stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to move a single pair of nodes at a time.
 - A path guided, 1D linear SGD sort: Odgi implements a 1D linear, variation graph adjusted, multi-threaded version of the https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04626[Graph Drawing
   by Stochastic Gradient Descent] algorithm. The force-directed graph drawing algorithm minimizes the graph's energy function
   or stress level. It applies stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to move a single pair of nodes at a time. The path index is used to pick the terms to move stochastically. If ran with 1 thread only,
  the resulting order of the graph is deterministic. The seed is adjustable.

Sorting the paths in a graph my refine the sorting process. For the users' convenience, it is possible to specify a whole
pipeline of sorts within one parameter.

== OPTIONS

=== Graph Files IO

*-i, --idx*=_FILE_::
  File containing the succinct variation graph to sort. The file name usually ends with _.og_.

*-o, --out*=_FILE_::
  Write the sorted dynamic succinct variation graph to this file. A file ending with _.og_ is recommended.

*-s, --sort-order*=_FILE_::
  File containing the sort order. Each line contains one node identifier.

=== Topological Sorts

*-b, --breadth-first*::
  Use a (chunked) breadth first topological sort.

*-z, --depth-first*::
  Use a (chunked) depth first topological sort.

  Chunk size for the depth first topological sort. Specify how many nucleotides to grap at once in each DFS phace.

*-w, --two-way*::
  Use a two-way topological algorithm for sorting. It is a maximum of head-first and tail-first topological sort.

*-n, --no-seeds*::
  Don't use heads or tails to seed topological sort.

*-c, --cycle-breaking*::
  Use a cycle breaking sort.

  Load the path index from this _FILE_.

*-f, --path-sgd-use-paths*=FILE::
  Specify a line separated list of paths to sample from for the on the fly term generation process in the path guided linear 1D SGD. The default value are _all paths_.

*-G, --path-sgd-min-term-updates-paths*=_N_::

  Approximate maximum number of Zipfian distributions to calculate. The default value is _100_.
