== NAME

odgi_build - construct a dynamic succinct variation graph

== SYNOPSIS

*odgi build* [*-g, --gfa*=_FILE_] [*-o, --out*=_FILE_] [_OPTION_]...

== DESCRIPTION

The odgi build(1) command constructs a succinct variation graph from a GFA. Currently, only GFA1 is supported. For details of the format please see https://github.com/GFA-spec/GFA-spec/blob/master/GFA1.md.

== OPTIONS

=== Graph Files IO

*-g, --gfa*=_FILE_::
  GFA1 file containing the nodes, edges and paths to build a dynamic succinct variation graph from.

*-o, --out*=_FILE_::
  Write the dynamic succinct variation graph to this file. A file ending with _.og_ is recommended.

=== Graph Sorting

*-s, --sort*::
  Apply a general topological sort to the graph and order the node ids accordingly. A bidirected adaptation of Kahn's topological sort (1962) is used, which can handle components with no heads or tails. Here, both heads and tails are taken into account.

=== Processing Information

*-p, --progress*::
  Print progress updates to stdout.

*-d, --debug*::
  Verbosely print graph information to stderr. This includes the maximum node_id, the minimum node_id, the handle to node_id mapping, the deleted nodes and the path metadata.

*--trace*::
  Include backtrace information when reporting errors.

*-v, --verbose*::
  Verbosely print processing information to stderr, including debug-level log messages.

*-w, --warnings*::
  Turn on script warnings (applies to executed code).

*-t, --threads*=_N_::
  Number of threads to use for the parallel operations.

=== Program Information

*-h, --help*::
  Print a help message for *odgi build*.

== EXIT STATUS

*0*::
  Success.

*1*::
  Failure (syntax or usage error; parameter error; file processing failure; unexpected error).
